# :bread:'s Neovim config

I am big vim fan, but it's time to move on and try something new. This config was slowly
crafted to fit my own liking and styles. At the moment it is still very simple, more
changes and improvements to come. Configurations are kept minimal, any property that
matches its default value will not be included.
